From now on I'll be carrying a huge plushie rat with me (well, actually, it's a <abbr title="Rodent
of Unusual Size">R.O.U.S</abbr> given to me in very touching circumstances (well, kind of)).

Why? Why not! But just for the record, here are some more elaborate reasons:

- **It makes people laugh.** Me and my rat caused quite a number of laughs and enjoyable random
  talks with enjoyable random people in hallways in the one week of beta-testing. If there is a
  cheap way to generate laughter, it would be a shame not to use it.
- **Message: Judge by the important stuff.** By walking around with a huge plushie rat, I am
  declaring that I can afford to be considered weird, because I wish to be judged by things other
  than looking weird. Those people who can understand this will judge who I am, not what I look
  like. Those who can't are unimportant.
- **It changes what I seem to be, thereby changing who I feel like, too.** I just can't look all
  gloomy with a huge plushie rat in my arms, really. The image of a sad, angry, serious emo-kid that
  I sometimes assume when I feel I've failed just doesn't go with that (probably the Universe would
  explode in an epic burst of laughter or something). So, the Rat shall guard me from darkness!
  Yay :-D
