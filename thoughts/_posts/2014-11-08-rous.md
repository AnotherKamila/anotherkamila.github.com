From now on I'll be carrying a huge plushie rat with me (well, actually, it's a <abbr title="Rodent
of Unusual Size">R.O.U.S</abbr> given to me in very touching circumstances (well, kind of)).

Why? Why not! But just for the record, here are some more elaborate reasons:

1. **It makes people laugh.** Me and my rat caused quite a number of laughs and enjoyable random
   talks with enjoyable random people in hallways in the one week of beta-testing. If there is a
   cheap way to generate laughter, it would be a shame not to use it.
2. **Message: Judge by the important stuff.** By walking around with a huge plushie rat, I am
   declaring that I can afford to be considered weird, because I wish to be judged by things other
   than looking weird. If people can understand this, they will judge who I am, not what I look
   like. If they can't, it's not my problem.
3. **It changes who I present myself as, thereby changing who I feel like, too.** I just can't look
   all gloomy with a huge plushie rat in my arms, really. The image of a sad, angry, serious emo-kid
   that I sometimes assume when I feel I've failed just doesn't go with that (probably the Universe
   would explode in an epic burst of laughter or something). As follows from (1), I carry the rat to
   bring about laughter, and I'd better stay consistent while roaming around with that.
