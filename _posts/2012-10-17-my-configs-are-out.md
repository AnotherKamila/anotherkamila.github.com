I have finally managed to start cleaning up my dotfiles. The repository is at
[github.com/AnotherKamila/dotfiles](http://github.com/AnotherKamila/dotfiles), and I will hopefully
add other config files over time. I am particularly fond of my
[.inputrc](http://github.com/AnotherKamila/dotfiles/blob/master/.inputrc), which contains some
things I would love to have known sooner.
