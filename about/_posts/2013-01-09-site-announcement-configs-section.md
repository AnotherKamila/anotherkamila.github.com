I have started putting together what I have done to my beloved Thinkpad X1 Carbon. Of course it is
going to take a long time (especially with all the competitions that are coming up), but I have
started :D

This also means that this page might one day start looking less ugly. (As for the current state: I
know the typography still sucks, it hurts me, too! Sorry!)
