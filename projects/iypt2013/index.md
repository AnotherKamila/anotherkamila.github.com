None of these presentations was made by me alone (actually, quite the opposite — the hard work was mostly carried out by others). The co-authors for each are listed below together with the links to the files. Thanks a lot!

*note about the file format: I am terribly sorry for providing only PPTX (from PowerPoint 2010), the reason is that the presentations contain a lot of animations and other things that wouldn't survive conversion.*

- [1 - Invent Yourself](http://ksp.sk/~kamila/01.pptx) (Boris Vavrík, Michal Hledík)
- [2 - Elastic Space](http://ksp.sk/~kamila/02.pptx) (Michal Ďurian, Andrej Vlček, Martin Gažo; some experimental data by the GJH team)
- [11 - Ball Bearing Motor](http://ksp.sk/~kamila/11.pptx) (Adam Dej)
- [13 - Honey Coils](http://ksp.sk/~kamila/13.pptx) (Michal Hledík, Matej Badin)
- [16 - Hoops](http://ksp.sk/~kamila/13.pptx) (Michal Hledík, Matej Badin)

Also note that while my work is licensed [freely](/LICENSE), I cannot speak for the others, and therefore these presentations are to be considered copyrighted by the respective authors.
