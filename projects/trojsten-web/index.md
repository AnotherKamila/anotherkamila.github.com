This horrible thing is in its earliest stage of planning.

A copy of my notes.txt might (or might not, depending on when they clear the demo server database) be available [here](http://beta.etherpad.org/p/3stenGUT) (thanks, [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org)!); if you know what this is about and feel the need to add something, please do so!

**Update (2013/08/05):** This horrible thing is no longer in its earliest stage of planning â€” we have actually written some code already. But it is not in a state suitable for public display just yet :-D
